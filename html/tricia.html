<p>I am in love.

<p>She is beautiful. She is smart. She's bashful. Finicky. Very sweet. Moody. Diligent. Lazy. Deep. Irritable. Goofy. Definitely attractive. Sexy? Could be, but I need time to think about it. Did I already mention that she is very very sweet?

<p>She's a paradox of perfections and imperfections. She's all the things I never knew I wanted.

<p>There are only so many ways to say that I love you. So I imagine showing it would be easier; if only we are near each other. I wanted to show her things that she haven't seen. To make her experience things she haven't done. Cooking for someone isn't really my cup of tea. Getting so attached and in love to afford changing schedules just to walk home with her. Being worked up with the least of touch, wrinkling a smile with the corniest of jokes.

<p>I can't imagine spending a lifetime with someone other than her. I'm sure there are countless other girls I could woo that are smarter, sweeter, sexier and a have host of talents that would make the 'single' me gasp at the slightest of eye collision. But I choose her. This girl who made me feel :)

<p>There are only so many ways to say that I love you. I'll use one right now.

<p>I have been saying it all year. I love you baby! Happy 2016! :)
