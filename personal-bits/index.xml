      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always been an expert in forgetting faces. Or names. Lately they have been getting worse. Was it always like this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, they were unnoticeable things. Inconspicious things that is not even worthy to be remembered. It is normal to forget names and faces and places and things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also like to mention that my eyesight has been getting worse lately. I&amp;rsquo;m 24 with astigmatism and over &lt;sup&gt;150&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;150&lt;/sub&gt;+ vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an armchair optometrist/psychologist, I have a theory (hunch? assertion? guess?) that memory is linked to blurred vision. Once the sight has dulled, the ability to retain details in memory will dull too. It makes sense that with clear vision, a person has a lot more detail to work with when remembering things. A quick &lt;a href=&#34;http://google.com/search?q=sight+memory&#34;&gt;Google search&lt;/a&gt; does not show any studies related to this. Should I ask a psychologist? Or maybe AskScience, maybe later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And right, it is Christmas in our side of the world. &lt;strong&gt;Merry christmas everyone&lt;/strong&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;
